## Junk Mail Be Gone

Junk Mail Be Gone is a chrome extension that helps you to unsubscribe from unwanted junk mails and catalogs.

## Description

Businesses send catalogs and promotional mails every day, even when we have never signed up for them. Most of these end up in the trash can, whether they get recycled or not. This is a bane to the environment because of the amount of paper that is wasted, not to mention an utter annoyance for us to have to sift through them and find mails that are actually important.
